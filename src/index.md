Welcome to the simple start of my digital garden. 

*What is a Digital Garden?*

A "Digital Garden" is a metaphorical space where ideas are born, grow and develop fully in view of any visitors and subject to the loving care, craft and hands-in-dirt effort of the creator. In revealing the entire life cycle of my ideas I am implementing online what I've found to be true offline in human relationships and that is the rewarding returns that come from being vulnerable and open. Portfolios are often artificial portraits of a creative career in which only the beautiful or successful projects, clients and pursuits are featured. While they can be impressive, I believe that most visitors can feel the artifice that radiates a lack of confidence, of self-love or well-roundedness.

*Who are you and how's it growing?*

I'm ely kahn. I've been growing for 35 years, with years of expansive learning and creation, success and satisfaction and some long streaks of broken branches, depletion of roots and shrinking structural supports(me as a plant). As a person I am both extraordinarily priveleged, having been born with outstanding intellectual abilities, a supportive family and access to educational opportunities that have helped me to this day. But I'm also totally fucked up. Not a little bit, and not just from my perspective, I'm broken in more ways than most people can even think of. I just checked my online medical record and the updated list of active diagnoses there includes 24 significant issues. Among them are epilepsy, a rare genetic immune difficiency that I typically have to school my own docs on, severe chronic pain aka post-thoracotomy pain syndrome(x2 for me), major depressive disorder, chronic fatigue, and on and on.
